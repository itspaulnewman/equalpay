<h2><strong>What Is the Tesco Equal Pay Compensation Case?</strong></h2>
<p>The Tesco equal pay case revolves around allegations that female shop floor workers were paid less than their male counterparts in distribution centres for performing work of equal value. This discrepancy has been described as a breach of both UK and EU laws on gender equality.</p>
<h2>Key Details:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pay Gap</strong>: Female shop workers were reportedly paid up to £3 less per hour than male warehouse workers, despite their roles being deemed comparable in value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Affected Employees</strong>: Around 25,000 current and former female employees may be eligible for compensation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>Streamlined Legal Process (2022)</h2>
<p>To expedite proceedings, UK tribunals decided to focus on six key test cases rather than examining thousands individually. This approach aims to shorten litigation timelines and compel Tesco to disclose critical documentation.</p>
